# DALL-E 3 Image Generator Script

This Python script allows users to interact with OpenAI's DALL-E 3 API to generate images based on text prompts. It prompts the user to enter some text, submits this text to the DALL-E 3 model, and if successful, returns the URL of the requested image.

**NOTE**: OpenAI API documentation may change in the future. For the most current information, visit the official [OpenAI site for developers](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images/introduction).

## Important Note
The images generated by the DALL-E 3 API are typically available for a short period of time, approximately 1 hour, before they are no longer accessible via the URL.

## Authentication
The script requires an API key from OpenAI for authentication. Before running the script, set up an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key. Retrieve your API key from your [API Keys page on OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

For assistance on setting up environment variables:
- On Windows, follow Microsoft's guide on [Environment Variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/environment-variables).
- On Linux/Unix, refer to the guide on [setting environment variables in Linux](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-set-and-list-environment-variables-in-linux/).

## Features

- Interactive prompt for user input.
- Integration with OpenAI's DALL-E 3 API.
- Returns the URL of the generated image based on the user's text input.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.x or above)
- `requests` library for Python (for making HTTP requests)
- An API key from OpenAI for DALL-E 3 access

## Installation

1. Install Python from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install the `requests` library using:
   `pip install requests`
4. Set up an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key. 

## Usage

Run the script in a Python environment. Follow the interactive prompts to enter your text for image generation and receive the image URL.
